# Prescriptive

I read some articles on perspective rendering (specifically [The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer][rendering-essay]) and decided to roll my own.  I also wanted to play with [THREE.js][three-js] and see how they did stuff.

## Nomenclature

I was messing with perspective and this was the best name I could think of.
